# Startup-Auto

This is a python script designed to automate startup applications and desktop monitor configuration.

The execution of the script is configurable, utilising a configuration file which is stored in the user's home directory.

Folders are created/used for each Setting/Feature, and can be divided into 5 options
1. Main Shortcuts
2. Dashboard Shortcuts
3. SAP Shortcuts
4. MOP Shortcuts
5. Monitor Configuration

If the required folders are not present, the user will be prompted to create them, if the settings have been enabled

The script will automatically set itself up with a configuration file if it is not present in the home directory (i.e. Initial Run)
